      <h1>happy early spring to all!</h1>
      <p>Happy early spring to all!  The lack of snow during what is typically a busy snow month has provided my team and I an opportunity to actually prepare for spring! 

Spring efforts will begin next week!  Driveway cleanup, lawn cleanup, power brooming and turf repair. 

Fully equipped with dump truck, mini excavator, skid steer and Harley rake for any and all driveway repairs and topping. 

As always, we are a one stop shop for everything outdoors.  Mulching, deliveries, lawn care, planting - trees, shrubs, annuals & perennials. </p>
      
      <p> Check out our past photos of patios, walkways and walls. 

Feel free to reach out anytime for a free estimate!   802-355-0991

Pictures attached were from last seasons work I never posted! 

Happy spring!</p>

Laying some thermal blue stone, no joints, in South Burlington.  And a paved driveway extension.  Very pleased with results.  With almost zero lawn impact.
